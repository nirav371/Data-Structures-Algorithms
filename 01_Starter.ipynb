    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Functions**\n",

    "**Array Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an array\n",
    "my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing elements by index\n",
    "print(my_array[0])  # Prints 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying elements by index\n",
    "my_array[1] = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding the length of an array\n",
    "length = len(my_array)  # Length is 5\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Searching Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common searching algorithms are Linear Search and Binary Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def linear_search(arr, target):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "        if arr[i] == target:\n",
    "            return i  # Return the index where the target is found\n",
    "    return -1  # Return -1 if the target is not in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "result = linear_search(my_array, 4)  # Searches for 4 in my_array\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Search (for sorted arrays):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search(arr, target):\n",
    "    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    while left <= right:\n",
    "        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n",
    "        if arr[mid] == target:\n",
    "            return mid\n",
    "        elif arr[mid] < target:\n",
    "            left = mid + 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            right = mid - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return -1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make sure the array is sorted for binary search\n",
    "sorted_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "result = binary_search(sorted_array, 4)  # Searches for 4 in sorted_array\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorting Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various sorting algorithms. Here's an example of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bubble_sort(arr):\n",
    "    n = len(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n",
    "            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n",
    "                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]  # Swap elements\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sorting an array\n",
    "my_array = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n",
    "bubble_sort(my_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice these array-related operations and algorithms. When you're ready, we can move on to the next topic, which will be Linked Lists. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
