    "Certainly! Memoization is a technique used in computer programming to optimize the performance of algorithms, particularly recursive algorithms. It involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again, instead of recalculating the result. This can dramatically reduce the time complexity of certain algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind memoization is to trade off space for time. By caching and reusing previously computed results, you can avoid redundant work, especially in cases where the same subproblems are encountered multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how memoization typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a function:** You start with a recursive function that might have overlapping subproblems. These subproblems are smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "2. **Create a data structure:** Usually, a data structure like a dictionary or an array is used to store the results of function calls based on their inputs. Each entry in the data structure maps an input to its corresponding result.\n",
    "3. **Check if result exists:** Before performing the computation, the function checks whether the result for the current input is already stored in the data structure (the cache).\n",
    "4. **Compute and cache the result:** If the result is not in the cache, the function performs the computation and stores the result in the cache for future use.\n",
    "5. **Return the result:** Finally, the function returns the computed result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example in Python to illustrate memoization using a Fibonacci sequence calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dictionary to store already computed Fibonacci numbers\n",
    "fib_cache = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    # Check if the result is in the cache\n",
    "    if n in fib_cache:\n",
    "        return fib_cache[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Base cases\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        result = 0\n",
    "    elif n == 1:\n",
    "        result = 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Recursive call with memoization\n",
    "        result = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Cache the result and return it\n",
    "    fib_cache[n] = result\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, as you calculate Fibonacci numbers, you store the results in the `fib_cache` dictionary. This prevents recalculating the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times, reducing the time complexity of the algorithm from exponential to linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization is commonly used in dynamic programming, recursive algorithms, and other situations where you can exploit overlapping subproblems to improve efficiency. It's a powerful tool for optimizing algorithms and is widely used in various domains of computer science and software development.\n",

    "3. **If an algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), what does that mean?**\n",
    "    - An algorithm with O(1) space complexity uses a constant amount of memory space that does not depend on the input size.\n",
    "4. **How does the space complexity of an algorithm relate to the memory usage as the input size increases?**\n",

    "7. **How does memoization impact the space complexity of recursive algorithms?**\n",
    "    - Memoization increases the space complexity as it requires additional memory to cache the results of function calls. However, it can significantly reduce time complexity by avoiding redundant computations.\n",
    "8. **Compare linear space (O(n)) and constant space (O(1)) in terms of space complexity.**\n",
    "    - Linear space complexity means that memory usage scales linearly with the input size, while constant space complexity means that memory usage remains the same regardless of the input size.\n",
