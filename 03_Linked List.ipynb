    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can efficiently grow or shrink as needed, making them suitable for situations where the size of the data structure is unknown in advance.\n",
    "2. **Insertion and Deletion:** Linked lists excel at insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning and middle. This property makes them useful in scenarios where frequent modifications are required.\n",
    "3. **Memory Efficiency:** Linked lists use memory more efficiently than arrays, as they allocate memory for nodes only when needed. This can be beneficial in resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "4. **Traversal:** Traversing a linked list is straightforward and can be done linearly from the beginning to the end or vice versa in the case of doubly linked lists.\n",
    "5. **Random Access:** Linked lists do not support efficient random access (accessing elements by index) because you need to traverse from the beginning to find a specific element.\n",

    "**Operations:**\n",
    "- **Insertion:** When a new identifier is encountered in the code, a new node is created and inserted into the linked list.\n",
    "- **Search:** To look up an identifier, you traverse the linked list and search for a node with a matching name.\n",
    "- **Update:** You can update the attributes of an identifier by modifying the corresponding node.\n",
    "- **Deletion:** If an identifier goes out of scope or is no longer needed, you can delete the corresponding node from the list.\n",
